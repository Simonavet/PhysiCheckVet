                                              PhysiCheck â€“ Vet 1.0 JS

This is a personal project that shows the user if the physiological parameters of different animal species are low, normal or high. 
 
I created it thinking to help veterinary students and veterinarians.
 
This is an application that I would have liked to have it during my studies in veterinary medicine and my short career as a veterinarian at the veterinary emergency hospital. 

Sure, a good veterinary doctor can memorize the normal physiological parameters of the animals that he usually works with, but it happens, especially in pet clinics to have special patients, like exotic animals, or in zoos, there are a lot of species. So, in these cases an application like this is very useful. The vet just takes out his smartphone, introduces the measured values and gets the answers. 

The application was made in JavaScript programming language with the IDE ItelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2022.1.3. 

I prefer not to give much information about how it works, as I want to develop it more, and I hope one day it will enter in production at some software company.

If someone is interested in it, can contact me.
